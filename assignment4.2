What percentage of DC drivers have gotten a ticket from an automated camera in the district?

I want to know what percentage of the tickets issued are to DC residents versus out-of-DC residents. Additionally, it would be interesting to know the number of DC drivers who have gotten tickets from an automated camera in DC. The first half of this data is publicly available for some years, but only by license plate data.

The best way to collect this data would probably be survey data. I could ask around and get a solid idea of how many drivers in DC get automated tickets.
