This article is a collection of mini/upcoming stories relating to business and their impacts, with each story accompanied by a graph. This is basically supposed to operate as a quick way to consume info about each of these topics, and for that purpose, I think it does a good job. However, I would've liked to see more than just one graph for each issue. I know this is supposed to be a short piece about a lot of topics, but some of the information definitely felt like they needed more analysis to understand. The graphs they did include were quite helpful, so I would've preferred to see more of that.
