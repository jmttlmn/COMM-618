My story focuses on automated traffic enforcement cameras, specifically located in the third ward. Ward three currently has thirty automated cameras, and I have already built an inventory of each camera’s type, exact location and installation date. Using a crash dataset covering every reported crash in Ward three since 2010, I will evaluate whether camera installations align with measurable changes in crash frequency and severity near each site. I will compare pre- and post-installation windows and use distance buffers around each camera, with comparisons to similar nearby road segments without cameras. To strengthen the test, I will measure crash type and injury severity to ensure that the crashes relate to whatever camera is installed (speed cameras versus red light violations). Additionally, I will need to consider traffic volume and that certain intersections will see more crashes due to having more cars. I will also ask DDOT and Ward 3 stakeholders why cameras were placed where they are and what success metrics they use.  I also plan on conducting a short survey to estimate what share of DC residents have received automated tickets and how experiences differ for DC versus non-DC residents. For the finale story, I hope to have maps visualizing the change in crashes (or lack of change), along with a visualization showing how many DC drivers have gotten tickets.
