I felt like this article did a really good job at using simple data visualization to show how the Supreme Court decision impacts some, not all, of Trump's tariffs and which countries specifically. I particularly liked how you could click through each section at the top, which made it really easy to quickly flip through and see what is being changed. Since the tariffs on specific products, such as steel, remain unaffected, a map showing where these products are coming from most often could be helpful to see where the US will continue to lose out on trade revenue.
