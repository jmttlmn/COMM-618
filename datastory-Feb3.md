I really like this article because it brings in data from lots of other places, which helps put the issue in perspective. Additionally, I felt like the graphs they used throughout were extremely helpful in understanding the importance of the issue. They used data to dispel many of the primary arguments surrounding increasing the minimum wage, which I also really liked. They did a really good job of tying the numbers into everyday costs like housing and basic living expenses, because it shows what $7.25 actually means in practice. Overall, it felt like a strong example of data journalism because the reporting is built around measurable claims, not just opinions.
